" 12/4/2016 Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The service is great here. There are plenty of seating and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seating aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be vibe, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :) "
" 10/25/2016 1 check-in I'd be wanting to try this spot for a long time and when the opportunity finally presented itself, I eagerly jumped!  After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go coffee, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of vibe of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing vibe with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for vibe looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice seating in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait service, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me. In addition, compared to the standard sizes seen elsewhere in coffee shops, the large was more like a small. "
" 12/1/2016 1 check-in Really cool place! I had a meeting scheduled here by someone, and I am so glad they did. Great vibe and vibe! Highly recommend!  This is a gem! "
" 7/29/2016 3 check-ins This location is on par with it's OG location (North Loop) it terms of drinks and the vibe is pretty good. I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first hoursed they used to make food and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be hours until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be hours 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The vibe. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The service often have the vibe BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the vibe in front of you. I can't think. Don't even try talking a call inside... They also play weird shit. Play something your general customer population will enjoy, I'm not into your 80s metal. *** As I am writing this! A second group of moved out side ""is it quite out there?"" *** "
" 11/17/2015 7 check-ins Love this place! Excellent coffee. Great layout, vibe and warm vibe, always friendly service, seating seating out back. A small vibe bar as well. This place is usually pretty vibe when I go in between 12 and 3. Lots of vibe on their laptops. They do have some food, I think most is premade. "
" 9/12/2016 Listed in Coffee Shop Working This is my favorite place to drink coffee and work. It's in a nice complex where you can parking around for a break. "
" 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their coffee. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum vibe piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an coffee the first time I stop in and unlike many places the coffee was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seating taken by vibe with laptops and seatingts, but still more than adequate seating.  service's seemed chill and friendly enough for me. "
" 3/10/2016 1 check-in This coffee place is a hidden gem in North Austin.  Think a cross between Mozart's and ""your local"" where vibe know you and actually talk to you.  They don't just ask your name.  Their coffee vibe was the best I've seen, and yes, I've been to Medici Really pretty coffee vibe on my coffee "
" 8/23/2016 Love Epoch!! hands down my favorite coffee shop in North Austin. Could live off those Iced Mojo's :) "
" 4/8/2016 One of my favorite coffee places. I get a iced soy vanilla coffee, the coffee is amazing! My only complaint is they only have one size and it is small for the price compared to other local coffee shops but you do get what you price for in flavor. "
" 7/6/2016 I ordered the vanilla almond milk coffee and fell in love. It's everything a coffee should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The vibe is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back vibe.  The service was so sweet and patient with me and all of my questions. ""What's good here?"" ""Do u have vanilla almond milk?"" Ect. The drink was made in a jiffy with a beautiful coffee leaf design to go. I will definitely be coming back soon. "
" 3/14/2015 1 check-in On convenience, really good wireless connectivity. friendliness ...they are really really good, but if rating them on coffee...it is definitely meh.  But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a coffee, but a pour over or do a coffee. They guys have a pretty bad price machine to pull coffee, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.  On the other side of coin is easy accessibility, really good connection speeds, reasonable service and fairly helpful service then ends up with this place being A-OK. A fairly pedestrian coffee. ..no discernable crema "
" 4/23/2016 3 check-ins Great coffee and coffee. Above average internet. Lots of seating. Not enough power internet. OK outdoor space. "
" 1/26/2015 Updated review Still love this place! We went in November when it was delightfully nice out and had a couple of vanilla coffee outside and it was really great. "
" 3/12/2016 So much improvement!!! This place has totally turned it around since they hoursed. That was rocky. Now it's lovely. The service is great it's clean. Drinks are on point. Great service guys. Oh and the bottled water helps support drug and alcohol recovery so that's awesome! "
" 11/2/2014 292 check-ins My location was low on local coffee shops, so I was thrilled when Epoch hoursed a new location right around the corner. I like the original location ok, but this one suits my style a bit more. (Yeah, I know, I'm a bit of yuppie.) They also display local vibeists work.  There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of seatings for working, and a seating out back. The service are always friendly and willing to debate you on which Star Wars movie is best, plus they make a mean coffee.  NOTE: They FINALLY fixed that second door in the ladies seating a couple months ago. "
" 5/10/2015 The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one vibe working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's food's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why vibe are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell food (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hoursly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a coffee & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvÌ©e that is used for coffee. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy coffee, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the service will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has parkinged in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the service, who is kinda vibe, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of vibe. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the vibe is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good seating in the back. "
" 8/30/2014 1 check-in Good place. Got italian soda and fruit and hubby got the iced cappuicunio. parkingamel sounds good. Relaxing w book.he fixed problem because it was not good and all the parkingamel was at the bottom. They even have board games to play, and peaceful vibe. Cappuicino Italian soda Good fruit cup See all photos from Wendy K. for Epoch Coffee "
" 7/20/2015 Updated review My opinion of this coffee shop has declined somewhat since my original review.  A few notable bad vibes:  - Standing and waiting for the service to serve me, even though there was no one else in line.  I had to finally say ""excuse me, can I get some service?"" to get said service to do his service. -  Ordering a coffee, only to find -- they're out of coffee.  This has actually happened a few times.  I had to wait for them to coffee a fresh batch. -  Some days, the coffee tastes like watered-down swill.  Other days, it's delicious.  This place happens to be right around the corner from where I work, so I keep giving it chances.  Wish the service would get it together. "
" 1/29/2014 Four stars means that I liked it AND I'm coming back here preferentially when in the area :)  Because there are no coffeehops in North Austin as awesome as Epoch and as accessible!  The coffee, tea, and food selection is good, but that's not why you come to Epoch!  You come here because you need some downtime, maybe on a couch, with some internet and isolation.  Or you come here because you need a vibe place to chat with a friend or three.  Or you can come here to play games with folks.  It all works at Epoch.    I no longer have to drive 30 min to get to North Loop and Guadalupe--halleloo. "
" 6/19/2015 Their coffee is vibrant and juicy, they insist relentlessly on quality ingredients, and I have never had a negative vibe with any of the service. I really like the wide space available and it is a calm, sedate place - not crammed with noisy meetings or unsupervised children. They have local almond milk available! I really love coming here before work to focus my thoughts or work vibely on a project. It's amazing to be here in the early hours especially, and I love having this charming little space in the location. "
" 12/4/2016 Cool location feel coffee shop.  I wish the location close to me (Anderson Lane) had the same vibe.  coffee por favor. "
" 11/10/2016 Nice hippe cafe with weird vibe in a positive way. Cold coffee was okay and it's nice to sit outside -- AC was a little too strong inside. "
" 8/15/2016 Best place for no-fuss coffee in town. seatinging is limited but if you're polite you can usually share a spot with someone.  Plenty of internet and good WiFi in a comfy and lived-in vibe.  Many reviews note that service is arrogant and rude which is simply untrue. They're very kind, just not as robotic and saccharine as vibe are used to at other businesses. "
" 4/13/2016 4 check-ins I was craving a Mexican coffee from Epoch so had to stop by before work. I bought a coffee to go and a bagel for about $6. Not Bad. This place is hours 24/7 so I never have to worry if I'm too early. It smells so good once you enter. There's nothing like parking into an aroma of coffee and sweets, just a bunch of healthy goodness. LOL One day I will get the chance to sit down and enjoy food here. So far work has my attention. I will be coming here more often! "
" 9/16/2015 15 check-ins The Good: internet is fast, coffee is great, and vibe don't bother you. Best place to chill and get some work done!  The Bad: if you want to enjoy outdoor seating vibe but hate being around smokers this may not be the place for you. "
" 9/2/2016 1 check-in I have nothing bad to say about this place. The coffee and coffee are great. The vibe are a mix of students, hipsters, locals, and poets that are left of center. Very relaxed place. Steady stream of vibe, but I have never vibed an unreasonably long wait. Great stop during the day. "
" 8/1/2015 1 check-in I was visiting a friend in Austin and Epoch was right across the street so I thought I'd check it out and get some work in for a couple hours. I'm not a big coffee drinker so you should be asking yourself why is he here but I was happy to see they have smoothies. I went with the Pineapple Paradise and yes it was paradise in my mouth. I'm not really sure what was in it other than pineapple but I'm not complaining! They also have pizza by the slice and I went with the white pizza (it has a crazy name which I can't remember). Solid and thin crust but a little bad price at $3.25 or $3.75 a slice...my memory is escaping me.  Maybe because the sightseeing at Epoch is spectacular. Hipsters galore in all assortments of ridiculous outfits. Even a girl with armpit hair, hooray! You will not be disappointed trust me. This is better than sightseeing at the airport or your local Walmart. "
" 10/4/2016 Had a coffee. Really nice and creamy coffee. service was nice. The food options looked good, but I didn't have anything. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. "
" 10/3/2016 Ok vibe, burnt coffee.  I wish they would use a better roast.  Will not go back. "
" 7/9/2016 The pizza was yummy. Coffee was perfect. service was friendly. Will definitely be back. In my top 3 places for coffee out here. It's a good place for some late night relaxing. "
" 11/11/2014 1 check-in Mojo...Hmm what's mojo? And why don't I have some already?    It was quite perfectly  a slow roasted coffee which produces a creamy texture.  I opted for the half mojo half iced coffee as I don't parkinge for things that are too sweet.  As Austin Powers once said ""Who stole my mojo?""  Trust me once you have had their mojo you will be back for more. Half ice mojo Half iced Coffee "
" 3/15/2015 1 check-in First time here and I'm not overly impressed. I came with two other vibe and they seem to have the same sentiment. vibe is nice, even though the vibe can be way too loud. Coffee and drinks are ok; we liked the Mexican Hot Chocolate. The service did not parkinge one bit that we were there. They're pretty sub par actually, and gave us an attitude.  Seems like an ok place to study, but it's more of a hipster cliche than anything. Meh.  Shoutout to the service with tape on his glasses: you're a service, you make coffee. You're not a distinguished vibeist or playwright so please smile, take yourself less seriously, and remove the obstruction from your bowels that's affecting your service. "
" 7/28/2015 1 check-in I came here on the way to a canoeing trip and it was so early that I was dying for coffee to function.  I just ordered a regular coffee and whatever beans they use are amazing!  It had the flavor, the kick you need and I didn't feel bad parting with my money after the cup was empty.  I also loved the interior; not too fancy and inviting!  Also, super good location to I-35 and more than enough parking!  They also have food foods that are really delicious and made to order!  You can't beat this for the price, quality and quick service on food and beverage items! "
" 2/13/2016 I lived within parking distance to this coffee shop for about a year. I would often find myself wandering over to have a cup of coffee and just sit outside on the seating. I thought of myself as a regular and found the service to be generally pleasant. A friend texted me asking if I would meet him at epoch for a quick chat. I had already purchased a coffee from another shop so I didn't feel the need to purchase one at epoch. My friend purchased his coffee at epoch and waited for me at a seating outside. We sat for about two minutes when a bald guy (epoch service) parkinged over and very snidely commented that these seatings were for vibe. I was so insulted! The friend I was meeting HAD purchased a drink from them. The place wasn't packed, there was space available. I am always very contentious of these types of situations, and had the place been vibeed, I would not have taken a seating. This guy went over board and they have lost my business for good. "
" 3/14/2016 Coffee was fine, food was fine. But the service was extremely impersonal and too busy trying to give me the total I owed rather actually listening to what I wanted.  I was seriously given the total 4 times in between telling them each coffee drink needed and each food item ordered. (And after living in New York I don't languish over ordering, and there was only one vibe in line behind me). I also wanted to buy some coffee beans but since I was getting pushed out the door, they missed that extra sale.  I'm pretty sure it'll be the only time I visit. "
" 9/11/2016 Great coffee shop! Solid coffee options, but almost always hard to get seating. Also wish there was a bigger no smoking section with more comfortable seating outside. "
" 1/9/2016 Thoroughly disappointed. I love exploring local coffee shops but this is one I won't be coming back to.  First, it has an unappetizing smell from the second you hours the door. Kind of musty and moldy. The woman who helped me seemed like me placing an order was an inconvenience to her. She had a huge attitude. And my chai tasted like the milk was microwaved. "
" 8/19/2016 Awesome place. The vibe is awesome, just my speed. Vintage lights and an earthy feel. The service was friendly and  appeared to enjoy their services which is important to me. "
" 2/17/2016 As a college student and avid coffee drinker (go figure), I've been trying to find some new coffee shops for a good study sesh. After reading some of the reviews here, I had high hopes for this place. I read such good things about the Mojo and, not being too crazy about super sweet drinks, I went with 1/2 Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee. I was hoping for something along the lines of a Summer Moon or a strong coffee flavor with smooth cream. Maybe it's because I got half, but I was pretty let down. First, it tasted watered down, like adding nonfat milk to weak coffee. Second, it tasted vibeificially sweetened. If you're a Starbucks vibe who gets iced coffee with nonfat milk, no classic, and a couple Splendas (I have credible Starbucks knowledge, trust), then the 1/2 Mojo is your cup of tea, rather, coffee. I'm not sure I want to spend about $4 to try a normal Mojo. ALSO..the guy at the register seemed like the type of guy who would often rub vibe the wrong way (no, not literally, you nasty. JK). At first, they forgot to add our bagel dog (tastes alriiiight) to our order, an honest mistake. Then, after waiting probably a good 20 minutes, turns out no one put it in the oven. Understandable if they were super busy, but there were maybe 2 other vibe waiting.  Now, the study vibe. Wi-Fi is great. I have yet to vibe any internet failure. They even have separate internets for inside and outside. They have a number of seatings and comfy looking couches and seating. Unfortunately, the spot my friend and I chose had loose internet so our plugs wouldn't stay connected. It's fine though, nothing a rubberband couldn't fix. Points for that Asian ingenuity! Okay, so it's 73 degrees outside and I'm kind of freezing in here. If you plan on staying for a while and you don't know how the study-at-a-coffee-shop thing goes, a jacket is a necessity. (I left mine in the parking, stupid me) Which brings me to the parking lot, which actually isn't too bad. I was fortunate enough to find an hours spot in the filled lot right when I turned in. But the lot is pretty big, so I wouldn't worry TOO much.  All in all, this place isn't bad, but probably won't be my go-to study spot. This is my first review, so don't totally take my word for it, but I've had my fair share of coffee shop vibes. You kind of have to get a feel of this place yourself. "
" 3/6/2016 This was one of the first coffee shops I vibed when I decided to attend school at UT Austin. A friend invited me out to check out the place while he was working on his dissertation. It was within parking distance. It didn't feel like any other coffee establishment I ever visited. Not only are there friendly service preparing drinks and food, it had such good vibe to the point where I immediately felt comfortable enough to take a short power nap on the couch next to my friend. I never recalled ever doing that in a public place in my life, and yet I felt so much at home. I was initially surprised by the variety of vibe you run into at this place. vibe were taking part in lively discussions and ideas while live vibe was playing in the background. There were several vibe playing chess outside. It was very enjoyable. "
" 1/15/2016 The I-35 of Austin coffee shops...always packed, bumper to bumper parking, slow moving line. "
" 7/31/2016 The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced coffee with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the service are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which vibeally turns me off to some coffee shops. "
" 5/13/2016 Wow. Had their coffee. It was outstanding. My Starbucks cultured taste buds now have a new definition of good coffee. Things will never be the same after this. One sip and i couldn't resist. Thought about licking the mug. But vibe were around. "
" 12/27/2015 1 check-in This place is busy busy. I see why now! The coffee is good and good price!!! It seems too busy and crammed though. Not a type of study place to go too if you're looking for vibe. There are tons of seatings and plugs for your laptop/charger though. service were friendly. "
" 7/13/2016 The food and coffee Drinks are great and usually decent customer service, but this time there was a new worker who seemed impatient and not friendly so I will probably not go back again. There's plenty of coffee shops in Austin where service is very very friendly! "

" 1/17/2014 13 check-ins Listed in Life is like a cup of coffee I had 45 minutes to kill before meeting a friend nearby for food and decided to check out this new Epoch location. There are 3 things I parkinge about when it comes to a coffee shop:  Good ice coffee (no bitterness) TopoChico A clean and comfortable place to sit  Epoch took parkinge of all 3. "
" 12/18/2013 118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's food, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly service who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel vibeality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine coffee's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo vibe, or the Anderson Lane food-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost vibely epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty coffee here for $3. Awww, coffee vibe. See all photos from Errol M. for Epoch Coffee "
" 4/23/2016 3 check-ins Great coffee and coffee. Above average internet. Lots of seating. Not enough power internet. OK outdoor space. "
" 4/2/2016 Good coffee, great location. Lots places to eat after. Had a  food that was fairly hard, so wasn't impressed with food selection. Study spot wise, it depends on the vibe working that day. There seems to always be louder vibe playing, and not the kind you can easily tune out, with certain vibe working. Genuine coffee us better for studying on those days, even though its smaller. "
" 1/26/2015 Updated review Still love this place! We went in November when it was delightfully nice out and had a couple of vanilla coffee outside and it was really great. "
" 8/7/2015 Good coffee, tea, and good food.  I'm a big fan of East Side so I of course loved their pizza.  No issues with the service or Internet.  The parking can be a little weird with the theater next door but that just means a bit further of a parking.  Ultimately the 5 stars come from the fact that there's nothing around it to compete.  Starbucks is ... well, you know.   Genuine coffee vibes have been mixed. "
" 12/28/2014 Love finding coffee seating. After a disappointing food at Korea House, we headed over here for some tea. I ordered a Coconut Chai tea (only comes in a pot). The service was really friendly. I loved the vibe feeling of the area. Thanks Austin! Coconut chai tea "

" 3/14/2014 8 check-ins Listed in coffee Boost In comparison to the original Epoch, I'm a huge fan. There's parking, hours seatings, and light! And the bathroom doesn't scare you. High fives all around.  I'm still a fan of the other Epoch, but this one suites me a bit more. They offer Cuvee coffee and will coffee it up via Chemex or Clever. The coffee coffee is good price, and refills are only $1. The coffee here is still good, but you can only go Mexican coffee. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most seatings are only for two vibe, so it's not great for big groups. There's some nice couch space  and bar seating here also. The wi-fi can be spotty though, so that's one knack on it.  Solid shop. "
" 5/20/2016 3 sips of coffee for $4.50 and great service! Plus fastest turtle speed internet. Deserves 1 great star! "
" 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop hours up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater seatings good for those on a date or (as most vibe were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater seatings in the back. It also seemed that they had a back seating.  Small selection of food from Russell's food. They also have a kitchen that makes food and foods from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place hoursed up here. "
" 4/28/2015 If you want to head here because you enjoy the original Epoch, don't bother. They get their food from a completely different vendor (I had a food that tasted like an undercooked pillsbury product) and I think the coffee is much worse. Plus, the vibe reads super snooty to me. I won't be returning. "
" 12/4/2016 Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The service is great here. There are plenty of seating and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seating aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be vibe, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :) "
" 12/1/2016 1 check-in Really cool place! I had a meeting scheduled here by someone, and I am so glad they did. Great vibe and vibe! Highly recommend!  This is a gem! "
" 8/8/2016 Easily my favorite coffee shop in the entire city.  Had a couple friends come in town, so I couldn't wait to take them there as they are both huge coffee fanatics as well.  Unfortunately, this time the service was less than acceptable.   The guy working the counter was clearly pissed off about working this day, and made sure that everyone ordering knew it.  I gave him my order and afterwards, he just looked at me, then told me the total, without ever acknowledging what I asked for; and same with my girlfriend. My friends were behind us and were ordering next.  They had never been here, and wanted something cold since it was so hot outside.  They tried ordering a ""frappucino"", and they got snapped back that they don't have ""frappucinos"".  They asked if they had something similar, and he said ""yeah, we have the ""blended"" drinks.  When they asked about what flavors were available, he said ""the sign is above you"".  They had never had Horchata before, so they asked what it was, and he responded ""it would take too long to explain what it is, so it is basically a cinnamon flavored coffee drink"".   Very disappointed with the service on this most recent visit, but at least the coffee drinks were great as always; just embarrassing to ""show off"" my favorite coffee place to out of town friends and get this type of visit.

" 9/1/2015 1 check-in I really liked the original Epoch location near airport blvd. I have good memories there, drinking coffee with my friends and eating good pasteries. I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for food and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the food.  I like this place, the vibe, and nice vibe working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" coffee coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.  Definetly a good location and parking is fairly easy. Coffee break "
" 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their coffee. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum vibe piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an coffee the first time I stop in and unlike many places the coffee was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seating taken by vibe with laptops and seatingts, but still more than adequate seating.  service's seemed chill and friendly enough for me. "
" 8/23/2016 Love Epoch!! hands down my favorite coffee shop in North Austin. Could live off those Iced Mojo's :) "
" 7/24/2016 Excellent Coffee. Really good vibe. I really enjoyed my vibe here. It was a really good place to get some work done. It is very vibe!!! They also have super fast internet too !!! "
" 10/29/2015 Updated review I went back to Epoch recently and I think they might have a new manager. They recently hours for a deep cleaning and it's WAY warmer in there now. Also the service that were jerks seem to be gone. The coffee is even better.  Seems like they're made a lot of positive changes, which is why I wanted to do this update! "
" 7/20/2014 4 check-ins I have held off on reviewing this place as I am very torn between three or four stars.  I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and service are great, but cleanliness and vibe are lacking.  My favorite is the cold coffee coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their coffee is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the food are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that service up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and food.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside seating when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.    I also like that this place is hours till 12 am, which makes a quick take away coffee before heading to a late night Alamo movie good location See all photos from Mindy H. for Epoch Coffee "
" 5/7/2016 Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite seating to quaff coffee and work. The service is friendly, kind, and  quick, the vibe is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF food, and even though sometimes it gets so vibeed I've parkinged in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is seating at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed hours later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop. "
" 8/17/2015 service: Super friendly and accommodating. Products: Great drinks and they parkingry Zhi Tea, which is the best tea in town Location: As a Northie, hard to beat. Always plenty of parking. So glad this place exists. "
" 12/28/2014 Love finding coffee seating. After a disappointing food at Korea House, we headed over here for some tea. I ordered a Coconut Chai tea (only comes in a pot). The service was really friendly. I loved the vibe feeling of the area. Thanks Austin! Coconut chai tea "
" 12/28/2014 1 check-in Pretty nice place here, very good vibe for studying if you can in a coffee house vibe. I got some coconut chai tea without milk and it cost around $4. The only complaint I would have was that after I finished the tea, there were these little bugs flying around and into my cup and it was a bit disgusting. Other than the fly problem, it was pretty good place and tea. The flies are an easy problem to get rid of. Coconut Chai coffee "
" 7/25/2016 Love this place. I usually get the coffee with almond milk. Always good. They serve Tyson's food foods in the morning. service are always friendly. Plenty of seatings and internet. Great spot to chill or get out of the office. "
" 7/29/2015 I have been to this place a couple of times -- usually Saturday afternoons.  I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold coffee anyway).   They make amaaaaazing coffee -- very smooth and drinkable.  vibe who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  price are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really seating and clean.  Overall, pretty good -- but definitely not the end all. "
" 9/19/2015 This place had a cute vibe, plenty of comfortable seating, extremely amiable service, and just a generally pleasant place to work. Unfortunately I have to dock it for it's coffee though. I haven't tried everything, but the few drinks I've had were ok at best. I haven't tried the food or the tea so I'm not reviewing those, but I do wish the coffee were better. That being said, I like sweet drinks so if you don't, then you'll probably like it more than I did. "
" 8/30/2014 1 check-in Good place. Got italian soda and fruit and hubby got the iced cappuicunio. parkingamel sounds good. Relaxing w book.he fixed problem because it was not good and all the parkingamel was at the bottom. They even have board games to play, and peaceful vibe.

" 3/10/2014 8 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp Challenge, Coffee addicts, step up! What the F is a coffee? I didn't know, so I ordered it. And surprisingly, I liked it. I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, hours 24 hours coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not hours 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to location. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside seating is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.  However, I like coffee, the W. Anderson Lane area, and Topo Chico :-) "
" 4/9/2015 2 check-ins Not sure what the issue was with the service before, but I had a wonderful visit.  The service made a few great suggestions on drinks and foods. Loved my Mexican coffee and Yoda (veggie) food.  Both were flavorful but not overpowering.  Nice rock vibe in the background,  really clean inside, and plenty of seating to get some work done.  I'll definitely be back! The order counter. View from my seating My Mexican coffee "
" 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop hours up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater seatings good for those on a date or (as most vibe were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater seatings in the back. It also seemed that they had a back seating.  Small selection of food from Russell's food. They also have a kitchen that makes food and foods from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place hoursed up here. "
" 1/16/2014 1 check-in I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine coffee's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are seatings, benches, sofas, comfy seating, plentiful internet...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the service and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y coffee so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a food unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood. "
